                Countdown is a global initiative to champion and accelerate
                solutions to the climate crisis, turning ideas into action. The
                goal: To build a better future by cutting greenhouse gas
                emissions in half by 2030 in the race to a zero-carbon world – a
                world that is safer, cleaner and fairer for everyone.

                We believe that change begins with each of us – that’s why
                TEDxPESU has launched its own chapter of Countdown. We will
                showcase the work and ideas of local thinkers and doers to spark
                a discussion, and help you understand how you can make a
                difference.
